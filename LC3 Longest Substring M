class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        maxi = 0
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in s[k: i]:
                k = k + s[k:].index(s[i]) + 1
            if maxi < len(s[k:i+1]):
                maxi = len(s[k:i+1])
        return maxi
